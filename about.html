    <p>
        Sahaja Yoga was founded in 1970 by <strong>Shri Mataji Nirmala Srivastava</strong>, 
        a spiritual teacher and humanitarian whose life mission was to bring inner peace 
        and self-realization to humanity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Practitioners of Sahaja Yoga believe that during meditation they experience a state 
        of <strong>self-realization</strong> produced by the awakening of the <em>Kundalini</em> 
        energy. This awakening is said to result in a state of <strong>thoughtless awareness</strong> 
        or <strong>mental silence</strong>, where the mind becomes calm and peaceful.
    </p>

    <p>
        Shri Mataji described Sahaja Yoga as the <strong>pure, universal religion</strong> 
        that integrates all other religions. She taught that true spirituality is innate 
        and can be experienced spontaneously without effort or cost.
    </p>

    <p>
        Shri Mataji stated that she was a <strong>divine incarnation</strong>, more precisely 
        an incarnation of the <strong>Holy Spirit</strong> or the <strong>Adi Shakti</strong> 
        of the Hindu tradition — the Great Mother Goddess — who had come to guide humanity 
        toward spiritual awakening. This is also how she is regarded by most of her devotees.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sahaja Yoga has sometimes been characterized as a cult by critics. However, followers 
        emphasize that it is a voluntary, free meditation practice focused on inner transformation, 
        moral living, and collective well-being.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, Sahaja Yoga is practiced worldwide and is offered free of charge, promoting 
        physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual balance.
